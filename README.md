## Project Description

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assist in early diabetes detection using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical health data, and its predictions can be utilized for preventive healthcare.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, and relevant features are selected for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A machine learning algorithm (e.g., KNN, SVM, etc.) is employed to train the predictive model.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset

### Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set. It contains 768 instances with 8 features.

### Features

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
